## *Skills*

#### Programming language proficiency

###### Intermediate
- **JavaScript** (self-taught, Makers bootcamp) - delivered a number of web applications using modern JavaScript (ES6+), simple command-line applications using Node.js, as well as limited experience using frontend frameworks including React.
- **Ruby** (Makers bootcamp) - learned software development fundamentals using Ruby, plus delivered full stack web applications using Ruby on Rails, including an API-only Ruby on Rails backend as part of a split architecture application.

###### Beginner
- **Java** (self-taught) - experience writing simple applications, including test-driven Java using JUnit, and the Spring Boot framework, plus Android experience from a previous job (2012).

#### Communication and writing

I enjoy writing and blogging. In 2019 I was shortlisted for a 'best blog' award for my weekly blog of my time at Makers. I also enjoy reading and reviewing books, primarily philosophy, science and social science. I am also a film photographer and digital artist. I am confident communicating what I'm working on to a large audience.

My most recent post, reflecting on my learning experience over the past few months, was featured on the main Makers blog and can be viewed here: [Makers, week 12: minimum viable programmer (and finishing Makers!)](https://blog.makersacademy.com/makers-week-12-minimum-viable-programmer-and-finishing-makers-38b389ec6b01).

#### Problem solving

I have experience with practical and theoretical problem solving, having studied **Engineering** (1.5 years) and **Philosophy** (3 years) at undergraduate level. In a previous job as an **Android developer intern** (2.5 months), I learned basic Java and was able to prototype a small Android app using various APIs in only a few weeks.

- During my software development internship (2012) at Waymont Consulting Ltd, a contractor for the Ministry of Defence (MoD), I designed a proprietary Android application which interfaced with a defence communications antenna.
- During my first year (2011-2012) at the University of Cambridge, my highest exam results were in the Mathematics and Computing paper.

## *Education*

#### Makers (September 2018 - December 2018)

- Makers is a leading software development bootcamp, based in London since 2012.
- I learned software development fundamentals through online resources, pair programming, and various agile team projects, in an intensive, competitive 12-week course.
- Technologies and methodologies: object-oriented design (OOD), test-driven development (TDD), model-view-controller (MVC), agile management, Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, Node.js, React, RSpec, Jasmine.
- Significant achievements include: successfully deploying a full stack web application with continuous integration (CI) to Amazon Web Services (week 9) and writing modern asynchronous JavaScript API calls using Promises bringing our final project application from ~50% reliability to ~100% reliability (week 12).

#### University of Bristol (September 2014 - July 2017)

- BA, Philosophy, 2.1
- First Class final year essays in Philosophy of Economics, and Philosophy of Psychology (Artificial Intelligence).

Name | Description | Technologies learned
--- | --- | ---
[Bank Tech Test](https://github.com/hnryjmes/bank-tech-test) (2018)  | Simple command-line application to model a bank account. Handles deposits, withdrawals, and prints bank statements. Used test-driven development and object-oriented design. | JavaScript, Node.js, Jasmine, ESLint.
[News Summary Challenge](https://github.com/hnryjmes/news-summary-challenge) (2018)  | Single-page news summary app (Hacker News clone) using two APIs. Test-driven. |  JavaScript, my own testing framework, ESLint.
[GIVEit](https://github.com/MugeHasilci/GIVEit-frontend) (2018)  | GIVEit is a social platform for connecting people in need with people offering goods and services that can help them. It is a split architecture web application with a React/JavaScript frontend and Rails API backend. | Ruby on Rails (API-only), RSpec, React, Jest, Enzyme, Cypress, Google Maps APIs, Material Design.
Antenna Control Application (2012)  | The project was to build a software application to control and interact with an industrial communications antenna. The finished application issued proprietary control messages over a secured network connection to display real-time updates on azimuth position/GPS and a dynamic plot of the frequency spectrum traces from the antenna. The user interface demonstrated various ways of controlling the antenna, including using a built-in camera in conjunction with gyroscope sensors on the device, an intuitive touchscreen interface, and a custom Google Maps implementation. The application was developed in accordance with best practices for current Android software, including features such as a tabbed interface and application lifecycle management to conserve battery life.  |  Android, Java, Eclipse.
