## Skills

#### Problem solving

In my previous job as an Android developer intern, I was faced with an unknown problem and designed a custom solution in a matter of weeks, learning a new language (Java) from scratch. I have experience with practical and theoretical problem solving, during my time studying Engineering (1.5 years) and Philosophy (3 years). 

- During my software development internship, I designed a proprietary Android application which interfaced with a defence communications antenna for Waymont Consulting Ltd, a contractor for the Ministry of Defence (MoD).
- At the University of Cambridge, my highest exam results were in the Mathematics and Computing paper, where I learned basic C++.

#### Programming language profiency

I have been following the technology industry for over a decade, witnessing the change from desktop-first to mobile-first, as well as the rise of cloud computing and machine learning. To supplement this interest I have used a number of programming languages.
- First website in HTML at age 10 (GeoCities, no longer online!).
- First programming experience using C++ at the University of Cambridge (pre-2015, they now teach Python).
- First software development job (internship) using Java for the Android platform.
- Self-taught languages: Python for Data Science (Udacity, DataCamp certificate), HTML/CSS (freeCodeCamp certificate), JavaScript (freeCodeCamp certificate).

#### Writing, art and design

I enjoy writing and blogging, having done so for a number of years, as well as reading and reviewing books, primarily philosophy, science and social science. I am also a film photographer and digital artist.
